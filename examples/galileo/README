Galileo Specific Examples
=======================

This directory contains galileo-specific example applications to illustrate
how to use galileo APIs.

In order to build a application, you should set the EXAMPLE environment
variable to the name of the application you want to build. For instance, if
you want to build gpio-output application, run the following command:
$ make TARGET=galileo EXAMPLE=gpio-output

GPIO Output
===========

This application shows how to use the GPIO driver APIs to manipulate output
pins. This application sets the GPIO 4 pin as output pin and toggles its
state at every half second.

For a visual effect, you should wire shield pin IO1 to a led in a protoboard.
Once the application is running, you should see a blinking LED.
